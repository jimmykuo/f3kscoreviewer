# About F3K Score Viewer

F3K Score Viewer let's you view [f3kscore](http://olgol.com/F3KScore/) files in your browser.

## Patching f3kscore to output xml files.

The save files of f3kscore are a serialisation of java objects, problem is that this binary format is difficult to read from JavaScript. 

Therefore I created a patch that allows f3kscore to output the save files as XML files. I use the 'xstream' [serializer from codehaus](http://xstream.codehaus.org/) for this.

To apply the patch, you need to run the 'build.sh' script in the f3kscore folder. This script downloads version 8.9 and creates a new zip with the patched version. You use the patched version on the command line like so:

    $> java -jar f3kscore_v8.9.jar <infile>.f3k

This will generate a '<infile>.f3k.xml' output file in the same folder as the original. You will see the UI popping up for a few seconds, but no user interaction is necessary.

## Using F3K Score Viewer online

Upload the newly generated XML file to the online application. It will parse and show the contest. There are also some predefined XML files from the Belgian contests in 2012.

## How does the application work?

The application is written in CoffeeScript and is a SPA using Backbone.js and some new HTML5 features, like the filesystem API, data urls (for csv exports). For templating I use the Mustache.js implementation. Everything runs on the client side.

## Why did you write this?

I was tired of writing a report after an F3K contest to share the results with others. I believe this to be a more approachable way to share contest results. Off course, you still need a fairly recent web browser and I only tested it in Chrome.

## The code

You can find the code on GitHub:
